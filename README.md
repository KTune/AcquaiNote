Then this app is for you!

Make separate profiles for the people you meet, take notes about their names, connections, important dates, likes, and dislikes.

AcquaiNote is built using kivy and kivymd python lybraries. Currently, he app can be run on Windows 10, but I plan to release the APK version for Android platform usage in the near future.
